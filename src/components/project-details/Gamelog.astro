    Technical Architecture
  </h3>
  <p>
    The project adopts a layered architecture to separate concerns and ensure maintainability. 
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2 mt-4">
    <li>
      <span class="font-bold text-slate-300">Backend (Spring Boot 3):</span> Leverages Java 21 and Spring Security for robust API protection. It utilizes <span class="text-green-400 font-mono">Redis</span> to cache temporary data such as email verification codes and password reset links, optimizing performance and security for short-lived tokens.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-bold text-slate-300">Frontend (React 19):</span> A Single Page Application (SPA) styled with Tailwind CSS. It uses React Context API for global state management and React DnD for the interactive Kanban board.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-bold text-slate-300">Database & Infrastructure:</span> Data is persisted in PostgreSQL, while the entire stack is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose for consistent deployment environments.
    </li>
  </ul>
