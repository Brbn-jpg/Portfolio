    Notepad-php is a simple, server-side rendered notepad application built with pure PHP. This project serves as an exercise in foundational web development principles, demonstrating how to build a functional application without relying on modern frameworks for the backend logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application handles user registration, login, and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for notes, managing state and rendering directly on the server.

    Project Philosophy
  </h3>
  <p>
    In an era of complex frameworks, the goal was to return to the basics. This project was built to reinforce a deep understanding of the HTTP request-response cycle, where every action is a form submission processed by a PHP script, which then re-renders the page with the updated state. A small amount of Vue.js was later added to enhance the UI with minor client-side reactivity without requiring a full page reload.
